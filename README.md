## 1. Problem Statement
Only 1/3 of Singaporean households own a car (Straits Times, 2023). For the rest, public transport is a paramount mode of commute in their daily lives. For the prospective home buyers among these public transport commuters, the connectivity between a residential area and important activity hubs in Singapore is an important factor to consider. However, few studies have come up with a connectivity score that is numerically easy to understand and compare. This project will attempt to fill in this gap and address the need of home buyers using a data-driven approach to identify areas that are well-connected in Singapore's public transport network.

## 2. Project Description
This project aims to create an app which displays connectivity of 55 residential areas in Singapore by public transport for those who are going to rent or buy a house in Singapore. By leveraging data from the LTA DataMall, OneMap and Google Map Platform, we will construct indicators of the accessibility and availability of the public transport to provide multifaceted insights for the app users. 
 
## 3. Data Source
Our datasets come from:
- [LTA DataMall](https://datamall.lta.gov.sg/content/datamall/en.html). The Land Transport Authority (LTA) spearheads land transport developments in Singapore, and we tap into their online data archive to obtain data on public transport from January 2022 to December 2023. 
- [OneMap API](https://www.onemap.gov.sg/api). The website provides geolocational data of Singapore's planning area.
- [Google Maps Platform](https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api). The platform provides real time and predicted future travel time data.
